## This studies is Simulate Employee Data Store System By using Cobol Languges 

By main feature is read employee data from text file and call specific data.

This Repositary are contain 2 Files First is .text file that include Employee Name Deparement and Salary.
2nd is Emp.cbl that contain cobol languages.

*My Recommendation for Cobol Tools is MyCobolIDE this software are easy for learn and complie*

Unfortunally one of my really big probem is I use MacBook Air M3 and MyCobolIDE aren't support Apple Silicon Ship at this moment, then I havve to move to VS Code instamd (My Lecturer Recommend.)

There are couple tips for biginners tocompline .cbl file or Cobol Languages you need to do 2 steps 

1. use command for compline 
    Example: my .cbl file name is Emp.cbl as you can see in files 

        cobc -x Emp.cbl

    all the compile resule and error will be accure here and it lean us to one annpying things that you need to save and use compile cpmmand again until there's no problem accure.
    when it compile sucessfully it will save show you executable file (usually named Emp if you didnâ€™t specify another output) don't be upset it not any thing harmful.

2. after compile sucessfully. to run and see the result.

        ./Emp

if every thing we talk before are collectly the result should be like this.

Have Fun With COBOL Himmie.
